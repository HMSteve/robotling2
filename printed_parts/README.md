### Notes

- `walki_15.FCStd` - the current FreeCAD file with all parts
- `bar.stl`, `bar_long.stl`, `bar_medium.stl` - only one of these is needed. They have different lengths, defining if the legs are parallel to each other (`bar`) or if the front and rear legs are angled slightly forwards and backwards, respectively (`bar_long`, `bar_medium`)
- `foot_left.stl`, `foot_right.stl` - feet to be attached to the legs (preliminary, not needed)
- `rear_bottom.stl`, `rear_bottom_lipo1000.stl` - only one of these is needed, depending on the battery holder. `rear_bottom` holds a 2x AAA battery cartridge, `rear_bottom_lipo1000` a ~1Ah LiPo (e.g. like [this](https://eckstein-shop.de/LiPo-Akku-Lithium-Ion-Polymer-Batterie-37V-1200mAh-JST-PH-Connector)).
- `sensor_adapter.stl`, `sensor_evo_mini.stl` - are needed to attached an Evo Mini ranging sensor.
