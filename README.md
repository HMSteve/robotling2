# Robotling 2

Robotling-2 is a small, simple 6-legged robot using the new Raspberry Pi microcontroller [RP2040](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/rp2040/getting-started/) as brain. To move around, it uses a simplified tripod walk that requires only three servo motors - inspired by a 20 year old book called ["Insectronics"](https://www.amazon.com/Insectronics-Build-Walking-Robot-Robotics-ebook/dp/B000W10R32).
